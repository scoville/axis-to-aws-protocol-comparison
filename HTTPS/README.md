# Environment
- AXIS Device:  9.25.1.5 firmware on AXIS P7304 Video Encoder
- We used this stream profile:

# AWS setup

## API Gateway Setup 
Step 1: Goto API Gateway, create new gateway, then click into Setting of that gateway:

Step2: Add mapping template for mkv file type whereby the content of the mapping template can be found [here](./API_gateway_to_lambda_to_S3/content_mapping_template.txt).

# Results

API gateway has a payload size limit of 10MB. 

- 1m post-buffer duration and 1m recurring event - rejected by API gateway for being too large payloads 

- 45s post-buffer duration and 45s recurring event- rejected by API gateway for being too large payload

- 15s post-buffer duration and 15s recurring event: this created clips but occasional dropped clips due to mysterious
